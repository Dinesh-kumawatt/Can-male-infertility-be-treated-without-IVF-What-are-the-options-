Yes, in many cases, male infertility can be treated without IVF. If sperm count is low but not zero, doctors may suggest lifestyle changes, medicines, or even IUI first.

Eating healthy, avoiding alcohol, quitting smoking, and taking supplements like zinc and CoQ10 can help improve sperm health.

If there is infection or hormone imbalance, it can be treated. Some men have blockages in sperm ducts â€“ in that case, small surgery can help.

IVF is needed only in severe sperm issues. If sperm count is very low or sperm cannot swim properly, then IVF with ICSI is best.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre, the male partner is checked carefully before jumping to IVF. Dr. Krupa Shah gives honest options, and only goes to IVF when really needed.
